####[Dim Desktop 70](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1130/dim-desktop-70/)
This extension adds a button with a light bulb to your panel. When clicked, the desktop brightness is reduced. Scroll to change the brightness. The main purpose is to keep your eyes calm when reading in the late evening. It is realized by a simple overlay with 70% opacity. It should work on a multimonitor desktop.

####[Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1036/extensions/)
Enable/disable easily gnome shell extensions from a menu in the top panel. Also allows to edit the settings of the extensions. Feedback welcome!

Sometimes it doesn't sync correctly. Hence, [<i class="icon-refresh"></i>Gnome Tweak Tool](#gnome-tweak-tool) is still the best choice.

####[Launch new instance](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/600/launch-new-instance/)
Always launch a new instance when clicking in the dash or the application view.
This extension is part of Classic Mode and is officially supported by GNOME. Please do not report bugs using the form below, use GNOME Bugzilla instead.

####[No Top Left Hot Corner](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/118/no-topleft-hot-corner/)
This extension disables the top left hot corners. You can still click on Activities or press the dedicated key to reach the overview. Since 3.8, should work with other extensions modifying the Activities button. On versions prior to 3.8, may not disable other hotcorners in multiscreen configurations and won't work on fallback/flashback mode.

####[OpenWeather](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/750/openweather/)

It must be frustrating to always aim for the small cross button.
Close windows with a button click (the middle one by default) when in overview mode.

####Redshift
A blue light filter.
Currently, this extension is not working on Wayland. The alternate solution is written [here](https://fedoramagazine.org/safe-eyes-redshift/). And starting from Gnome 3.24, there will be a in-built Night Light app to provide the same functionality.

####[Refresh Wifi Connections](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/905/refresh-wifi-connections/)
A real time-saver when connecting to the Internet.
gnome-shell does not request for wireless network scan once the wireless selection dialog once the dialog is opened. This extension adds a refresh button to the Wifi connection selection dialog to request for a network scan manually.

####[ShutdownTimer](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1152/shutdowntimer/)
Shutdown, restart and suspend your computer easily. Extension provides two time modes which allows user to set timer to desired time or set the time of desired action. Every action is also available via keyboard shortcut.

####[Status Area Horizontal Spacing](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/355/status-area-horizontal-spacing/)
After installing all these little stuff, the top right bar is definitely overflowed. Use this to make some space.
